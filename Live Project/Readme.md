Socket Programming in Java
Here I'm creating a client-Server App that sends messages
In the application I'll send messages to the server and server will display them until end the connection. 
In this I need to establish socket connection. Means that the two communicators know the details about their network location and Tcp Port.

The Data will be transferred and inputed using streams.
